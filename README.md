# FUSegNet

## Description will be added soon

FUSegNet and x-FUSegNet are implemented on top of [qubvel's](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) implementation.  

## Saved models
* [FUSegNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14HFRiNdeN10NPx7S6Lts4ymidNpjibI2?usp=sharing) trained on Chronic Wound dataset
* [xFUSegNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18696pUMWWdIOAgOLcXR_hut0ukKPXuV9?usp=sharing) trained on MICCAI FUSeg Challenge 2021 dataset

## Code description
utils
`names_oldDFU.py`: Lists AZH test dataset names into 10 categories. Categories are created based on %GT area in images.
`eval.py`: Performs data-based evaluation
`eval_categorically.py`: Performs data-based evaluation for each category.
`eval_boxplot.py`: Performs image-based evaluation for each category that is required for boxplot. The final output is 
	an excel file with multiple sheets. Each sheet stores results for a perticular category.
`boxplot.py`: Creates a boxplot. It utilizes the excel file generated by `eval_boxplot.py`.
`contour.py`: Draws contours around the wound region
